		  transition saw shifts in relationships between Puget Sound
		  residents and the military, from a traditional, almost
		  unanimous support for the military's presence in the
		  region, to the development of a much more hostile attitude
		  among some segments of the public. This change reflected
		  growing concerns about the environment and skepticism about
		  military-related economic growth. It was also shaped by
		  concerns about nuclear weapons and the role of the armed
		  services in {U.S.} foreign relations, the result of the
		  rebirth of the anti-nuclear movement across the United
