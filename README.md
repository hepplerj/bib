History Bibliography  
[Jason A. Heppler][]  
[jason@jasonheppler.org][]  

This is a [BibTeX][] database that I use for citing works in [Pandoc][]
and [LaTeX][]. Most of the material here is being used in my dissertation,
and reflects urban / environmental history and the history of the North
American West. The BibTeX entries are meant to work with the Chicago Manual
of Style citation format.

Feel free to use the database however you would like. Contributions are also
welcome, so feel free to [fork the repository][] and submit changes by sending
a pull request. 

The files in the `bibtool-rsc` directory are drawn from Kieran Healy's 
[socbib repository][]. They are used with the [BibTool][] utility and help
sort and normalize the BibTeX database. I also pair this with Lincoln Mullen's
[Bibkeys][] Ruby gem to generate a list of citation keys, which makes citing
sources easy in Pandoc/vim.
